## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.

Please report any security vulnerabilities privately. You can do this by using the GitHub Security Advisories feature (via the "Security" tab -> "Report a vulnerability") if enabled, or by directly contacting the repository maintainers.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We will endeavor to respond to your report as soon as possible and keep you informed of our progress towards a fix and announcement.
